                        Ecoraster is a permeable paving solution that allows for natural drainage into the ground without producing harmful runoff.
                        Ecoraster is manufactured using post-consumer plastic waste and distributed throughout North America. 
                        With the ability to withstand even the harshest of climates. Applications for Ecoraster are limitless. 
                        Ecoraster can be used to stabilize the ground to secure paving methodologies, or can be used to help reduce dust and mud in barns and horse paddocks. Large-scale construction projects like roadways and parking lots are ideal use-cases for Ecoraster as the grid-system can carry loads of 35 tons per sq.ft. 
                        It is plowable in the winter, and wonâ€™t buckle and shift as seasons change.
